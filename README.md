# Interactive-Dictionary
In this program an user can enter any word in English, and he will get back the meaning of it. That's not the real elegance of it. It is somewhat intelligent in deciding whether the entered word is correctly spelt or not and accordingly it will give a pop up message displaying some related word matches with what the user intended to enter. For a given word an user get multiple meaning of it with different aspect. Hence it's a great interactive program which can somehow replace the needs of google translator.
